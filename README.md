> IÂ²C API for the HTS221 humidity and temperature sensor

# [Documentation](https://docs.rs/hts221)

# Example

To use the driver, you must have a concrete implementation of the
[embedded-hal](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) traits.  This example uses
[linux-embedded-hal](http://crates.io/linux-embedded-hal):

``` rust
let mut i2c = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1")?;
let mut hts221 = hts221::Builder::new().build(&mut i2c)?;

let rh = hts221.humidity_x2(&mut i2c)?;
let deg_c = hts221.temperature_x8(&mut i2c)?;
println!("rH = {}%", rh as f32 / 2.0);
println!("Temp = {} deg C", deg_c as f32 / 8.0);
```
